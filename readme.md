## Short Description

Hey y'all, we are making POK3R! It's a multiplayer, on-chain decentralized poker game with video feeds. While half of the game is simply playing your cards right, the other half is also being able to read your opponent's face and fake them out! Watch whales duke it out live or watch previously broadcasted matches as VODs and cheer them on in the chat.

## Long Description

Online gambling has exploded into a [$50b industry](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market) over the recent years and you may have seen the, just as recent, takeover of sports or twitch advertising by online betting or gambling platforms. Additionally [California's Proposition 27](https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=27&year=2022) is on the ballot; which would allow online & mobile sports wagering outside of tribal lands on the condition that tribes & casinos contribute funds toward state efforts to address homelessness. We feel that blockchain can solve issues in this space before they arise by keeping things transparent and verifiably random (where applicable).

To meet this surge in demand, we are making POK3R! It's a multiplayer, on-chain decentralized poker game with video feeds. While half of the game is simply playing your cards right, the other half is also being able to read your opponent's face and fake them out! Watch whales duke it out live or watch previously broadcasted matches as VODs and cheer them on in the chat.
